HADIE - High Altitude Digital Imaging Experiment
------------------------------------------------

This is the software used on the Hadie flight computer. It's been written
for an ATmega644P clocked at 7.3728MHz but should be easy enough to adapt
to other AVR microcontrollers.

Requires avr-gcc to compile.
